# BYRDMR

## Summary:
A React app for the BYRDMR drone, with two views (and corresponding components): Hero and Contact. See below for more details on what's been done.

## Technologies and packages used:
* React.js (this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)
* HTML
* CSS
* axios
* Jest (and react-test-renderer)
* react-router-dom


## How to run locally:

Clone or download the repo
In the project directory, install dependencies: run `npm i` in Terminal
Start the development server: run `npm start`
Navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000` You should see the frontend being served to the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to test locally:

In the project directory, run `npm run test` in Terminal.
This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
Please note that although (snapshot) tests have been written, these are currently failing: see below in the 'next-steps and improvements' section for details of why.

## Other scripts
### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
